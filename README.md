## Gtfs Scala Toolkit

I basically wrote this to learn GTFS (static). I learn best by doing so

### CLI Tools

* gtfs-hash
* gtfs-cat

#### gtfs-cat

Install:

tbd, using jitpack + coursier

Usage:


### Codegen

Generates Scala case classes for gtfs files


### CSV
 CSV parser in parboiled2; used for both parsing gtfs files and parsing the gtfs spec
 by the codegen.
 
 
 ### Types
 This module was generated manually by codegen module; it's not yet automated
 and the generated code is currently in source control.
 
 
 ### TODO
 I'd like to use scalajs to make a chrome plugin
 for a very basic gtfs reader in chrome.
 Alternatively, I might try using javafx to make a GTFS GUI.
